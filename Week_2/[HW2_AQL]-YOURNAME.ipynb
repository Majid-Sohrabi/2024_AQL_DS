    "Implement all other variants of Mutations which are explained below (for the problem in seminar 2):\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **Displacement Mutation** is already implemented during the seminar, first, an index was generated then we changed the data of that index.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **Swap Mutation** generates an index and swaps the data of that index with the next gene.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) **Big Swap Mutation** generates two random indexes and changes the data of the two indexes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) **Inverse Mutation** generates two random indexes and then reverses the information of genes between two indexes.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Write a function for Mutation to do all different types of Mutation randomly during the process of the Genetic Algorithm (As we did for a crossover)\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Implement a mutation rate (impact) to specify how many genes should be changed for **Displacement Mutation** (e.g if the nVar = 10 and the mu_rate=0.2 then the number of changes for mutation should be two genes in one mutation process)\n",
